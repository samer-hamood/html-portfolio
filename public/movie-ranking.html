<h1>The Best Movies According to Samer</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
My favourite movie due to its non-stop action and efficiency.
</p>
<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>
Close second, the culmination of the overarching narrative of
the previous MCU movies forming the Infinity saga. Villain-centric, 
the movie focuses on the antagonist that it introduces.
</p>
<h3>Captain America: Civil War</h3>
<p>
Non-conventional story, having the heroes fighting each other.
